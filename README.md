# SysML-Sandbox
A SysMLv2 sandbox based on Eve Online.
Eve Online sets the backstage for experimenting with SysMLv2 with support of AI (Large Language Models) given the extensive freely open documentation available and the possibility to experience first hand the systems to be modelled.
The repository is meant for educational purposes and is an open invitation for anyone to use the available SysMLv2-Packages and to extend it via Pull Requests.

# File structure
Files are meant to hold configuration items. In every file there may be one or more packages that are versioned together.
As the project grows, more contextual configuration items will be required.

# The initial work: the Mining Frigate
The initial effort in this repository defines a mining frigate in the context of a mining corporation in the online game Eve-Online.
The model has been generated with the support of an LLM following a series of questions that are aimed to identify the operational motivation of the system of interest (the mining frigate) and ultimately define their problem space. The model is only based on those responses and further elaborated to represent the system model of a mining frigate class Venture following OOSEM.
